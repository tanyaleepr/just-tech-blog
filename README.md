# Just another tech blog

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this module, I built the back end for my first completely full-stack application, Just Tech Newsâ€”a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. I used Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connected my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on to deploy the application in [Heroku](https://evening-forest-63026.herokuapp.com/). I followed [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) example.
